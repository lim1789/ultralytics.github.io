## What is YOLOv5
---
YOLO an acronym for 'You only look once', is an object detection algorithm that divides images into a grid system. Each cell in the grid is responsible for detecting objects within itself.

YOLO is one of the most famous object detection algorithms due to its speed and accuracy.

## The History of YOLO

### YOLOv5
Shortly after the release of YOLOv4 Glenn Jocher introduced YOLOv5 using the Pytorch framework.  
The open source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)

**Author:** [Glenn Jocher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenn-jocher)  
**Released:** 18 May 2020

### YOLOv4
With the original authors work on YOLO coming to a standstill, YOLOv4 was released by Alexey Bochoknovskiy, Chien-Yao Wang, and Hong-Yuan Mark Liao.
The paper was titled [YOLOv4: Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934v1)

**Author:** [Alexey Bochoknovskiy](https://ru.linkedin.com/in/alexey-bochkovskiy-1213b542), [Chien-Yao Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chien-Yao-Wang), and [Hong-Yuan Mark Liao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Liao)  
**Released:** 23 April 2020

### YOLOv3
YOLOv3 improved on the YOLOv2 paper and both Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi, the original authors, contributed.  
Together they published [YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767v1)

**Released:** 8 Apr 2018

### YOLOv2
YOLOv2 was a joint endevor by Joseph Redmon the original author of YOLO and Ali Farhadi.  
Together they published [YOLO9000:Better, Faster, Stronger](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242v1)  

**Author:** [Joseph Redmon](https://pjreddie.com/) and [Ali Farhadi](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/ali)  
**Released:**  25 Dec 2016

### YOLOv1
YOLOv1 was released as a research paper by Joseph Redmon.  
The paper was titled [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)
